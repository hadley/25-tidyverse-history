<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tidy data;,citation_abstract=A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.;,citation_author=Hadley Wickham;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.18637/jss.v059.i10;,citation_volume=59;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Statistical Software;">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Unlike our universe, the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> did not start with a big bang. It started with a gradual accumulation of packages that eventually snowballed into the identification and naming of the tidyverse. In this paper, I’ll explore the process of its creation, starting from the influences that lead to the first packages of the proto-tidyverse, leading in to the early years of the tidyverse. I’ll then discuss the defining features of tidyverse, along with the contributions that I’m most proud off. The tidyverse is a colloborative project so I’ll discuss the tidyverse team at Posit and the important role played by the broader community. I’ll finish off with some thoughts about the current maturity of the tidyverse and where we might be heading next.</p>
<p>This article summarises almost 20 years of package development encompassing over 500 releases of 26 packages, as summarised by <a href="#fig-tidyverse-timeline" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. That means this write-up is necessarily abbreviated and when coupled with my fallible memory, that means I’ve almost certainly forgotton some important details. If you spot any important omissions, please <a href="https://github.com/hadley/25-tidyverse-history/issues">let me know</a> so I can fix it!</p>

<p>While the tidyverse was named in 2016, most of the packages that make it up were created earlier, as summarised by <a href="#fig-first-releases" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>. In this section, I’ll explores how the tidyverse came to be, a journey that’s inextricably tied to to the course of my career. I’ll begin the story with a couple of formative experiences growing up then continue on to my PhD where I created reshape and ggplot. Next we’ll move onto my professional career, first at Rice University where teaching forced my ideas to become more concrete and acessible, and then to RStudio (now Posit) where I was given the freedom and resources to dive deep in package development.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="growing-up">Growing up</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was very lucky to have access to computers from a very early age, thanks to my dad<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and this lead to an general interest in computers and programming. Thanks to my dad’s professional work with databases, I had conversations about relational database design and Codd’s third normal form much in earlier in life than usual. That lead to a lot of playing around in Microsoft Access, a desktop DBMS, and an eventual part-time job developing databases. This work was invaluable when I later came to wrestle with the data needed to fit statistical models.</p>
<p>From my mum I learned that you don’t need to ask permission to do good in the world<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. This meant that when I encountered data analysis problems that I thought I could solve, I felt empowered to not only solve them, but share my solutions with the world. From both my parents I gained the convinction those with abundant resources have a moral obligation to help those with less, which made it natural for those solutions to enter the world as open source software.</p>
<p>The final formative experience prior to my PhD was my undergraduate statistics degree at the University of Auckland, the birthplace of R. Unsurprisingly, many of my courses were taught using R, which meant that I started using R in 2003, at version 1.6.2. It’s fun to look back at my earliest R code: the files use a <code>.txt</code> extension, mix <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;-</code> for assignment, and use very inconsistent spacing.</p>

<section id="phd-2004-2008" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="phd-2004-2008">PhD (2004-2008)</h3>
<p>My undergraduate left me with a desire to learn more about statistics, and since my Dad had done his PhD at Cornell University, it seemed quite reasonable to look to the US to do my PhD too. This lead me to Iowa State University (ISU) and my major advisors Dianne Cook and Heike Hofmann.</p>
<p>At ISU, I was lucky enough to get a consulting assistanceship with the Agricultural Experiment Station, where I helped PhD students in other departments do their analyses. This work lead me to face two challenges that remain with me today:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hardest part of collaborative data analysis is not finding the correct statistical model, but getting the data into that a form that you can easily work with. This challenge lead to the creation of the <a href="http://had.co.nz/reshape/">reshape packge</a> which made it easier to work with a variety of input datasets by first converting to a “molten” form which you could then “cast” into the desired form<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I often found it hard to translate the plots that I pictured in my head into code using the existing toolkits of base or lattice <span class="citation" data-cites="lattice">(<a href="#ref-lattice" role="doc-biblioref">Sarkar 2008</a>)</span> graphics. At the same time I was reading the The Grammar of Graphics <span class="citation" data-cites="grammar-of-graphics">(<a href="#ref-grammar-of-graphics" role="doc-biblioref">Wilkinson 2012</a>)</span> and found its theory of visualization to be very compelling. But the only implementation available at the time was very expensive, so I decided I’d have a go at creating my own in R. That lead to ggplot and later ggplot2. During my time at ISU, I was very lucky to get the opportunity to meet Lee Wilkinson who was tremendously supportive on my work<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This work wouldn’t have been possible without Di and Heike, who let me work on what <strong>I</strong> thought was most important<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, regardless of whether or not it fit the mold of a traditional statistics PhD. They also provided aircover for me when I let my disdain for the utility of theoretical statistics shine a little too clearly, causing difficulties with the completion of the more traditional components of my PhD. My work at ISU culminated in my thesis “<a href="http://had.co.nz/thesis/practical-tools-hadley-wickham.pdf">Practical tools for exploring data and models</a>”, a write-up of the collection of R packages I had begun to amass and the ideas that underpinned them.</p>
</section>
<section id="rice-university-2008-2012" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rice-university-2008-2012">Rice University (2008-2012)</h3>
<p>After graduating from ISU, I got a job at Rice University. Here my most formative experience was teaching <a href="http://stat405.had.co.nz">Stat405</a>, “Introduction to Data Analysis”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. I taught this class four times (2009-2012) and found the experience of repeatedly teaching the same topics to new students to be extremely useful. It helped me to discover topics that students found hard to understand and tools that they found hard to use, and I could see the impact of my improvements to teaching and tooling from year-to-year. This lead to the creation of the <a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org">stringr</a> (2009) and <a href="https://lubridate.tidyverse.org">lubridate</a> (2010, with Garrett Grolemund) packages as I discovered that many students struggled to master the special cases of string and date-time manipulation in base R. It also catalysed my work on tidy data and group-wise manipulation that lead to the tidyr and dplyr packages which I discuss in the next section.</p>
<p>Throughout this time, the popularity of ggplot2 continued to rise, and I manage to carve out time to work on it, despite it not being research and thus not valued by my department. But my interactions with the community kept me motivated and continued to reinforce my belief that open source software development was valuable because it empowered others to do better data analysis. During this time I started work with Garrett Grolemund, as my PhD student, and Winston Chang, as a contractor. Most importantly for the the tidyverse, Garrett developed lubridate <span class="citation" data-cites="lubridate">(<a href="#ref-lubridate" role="doc-biblioref">Grolemund and Wickham 2011</a>)</span> and Winston worked on ggplot2, implementing new geoms like <code>geom_dotplot()</code> and <code>geom_violin()</code>, important infrastructure like the theme system and the underlying OOP system. I’m lucky to still count Garret and Winston as my colleagues at Posit.</p>
<p>During my time at Rice I had very little success with grants. I had a hard time packaging my work in a way that the people reviewing statistics grants at the NSF could make sense of, despite my absolute conviction that this work with important. I was fortunate to get a couple of small grants from BD and Google to work on plyr, reshape, and ggplot2, but these were nowhere near the amount of money I was expected to bring in. A paragraph from a final report to BD highlights my thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The generous support of BD has allowed me to implement many performance improvements to plyr, reshape and ggplot2, and begin work on the next generation of interactive graphics. Without such support, it is difficult for me to spend time on these projects as they do not directly contribute to my research portfolio. Your support not only gives me the financial backing to pursue these important optimisations, but also sends a strong signal to the statistics community that this work is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also worked tooling for package development, despite it similarly lacking any research merit. Because I was developing quite a few packages, it made sense to invest in tooling that helped me develop more reliable software in less time. This lead to the creation of the testthat (2009) and devtools (2011) packages, and taking over maintenance of the roxygen2 package<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (2011).</p>
</section>
<section id="rstudio-2012-" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rstudio-2012-">RStudio (2012-)</h3>
<p>In 2012, I left Rice for RStudio (now Posit), moving to a position where the practice of software engineering was valued and I no longer needed to produce papers or find grant money. This gave me the time and freedom to learn C++, an important tool that I was missing for writing high performance code. I was very lucky to be mentored by JJ Allaire which allowed my C++ skills to grow rapidly. Overall, my first few years at RStudio lead to an explosion of new packages because I had both the time to work on what I thought was important and the ability to invest in programming skills that were not valued in academia.</p>
<p>The most important new package was dplyr. dplyr grew from my dissatisfation using the plyr package to solve various grouped data frame problems. These problems tended to be simple to explain but hard to solve using existing tools. For example, you have the babynames dataset and want to figure out the rank of each name, within each combination of sex and year. Solving that problem required <code>plyr::ddply()</code> so called because the input is a data frame and we want the output also to be a data frame. This function has three arguments: the input data frame to work, how to split it up (by year and sex variables) and what we want to do to each piece (mutate it).</p>

<p>This code is unappealing for new users because it requires that you not only understand functions but also the basics of functional programming. This means that if you’re teaching R, you can’t teach it until later in the semester, even though the underlying task is straight forward and is something you want to be able to do early in your data analysis journey.</p>

<p>The design of dplyr was centered around verbs like <code>filter()</code>, <code>mutate()</code>, and <code>summarise()</code>, with names that evoked their desired purpose. Each verb did one thing well, and was designed to compose with other verbs in order to solve complex problems. While use dplyr does require learning some big new ideas, I found that students could learn them much more easily than functional programming.</p>
<p>The early years of dplyr benefited tremendously from the work of Romain François (initially as an RStudio contractor and then later as an employee). Thanks to his C++ expertise, dplyr also ended up being much faster than plyr, ensuring that there was an immediate payoff to learning it<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. One of the particularly nice features of dplyr is that you can use the same syntax with different backends. For example, you can use dbplyr (2017) to with work SQL database where instead of running R code, the package generates SQL code that is run in the database.</p>
<!-- My work on dplyr also lead to the development of the purrr package (2015). It's hard for me to describe exactly what purrr is, except that it provides a bunch of useful and consistent tools for functional programming. purrr was an update to plyr. plyr supported four main data structures: lists, data frames, and arrays. recognising that the data frame side of plyr was handled by dplyr, and arrays to not be that useful, extract out the list handling code into purrr. -->
<p>During this time I also started thinking about how data gets into R. This initially lead to work with R’s database ecosystem, taking of over maintenance of the DBI and RSQLite package from Seth Falcon (2013), creating bigrquery (2015) to make it possible to get data from Google’s BigQuery database, and forking RPostgres from the unmaintained RPostgresSQL (2015). This work was done in concert with Kirill Müller, who now maintains much of the database ecosystem thanks to funding from the R Consortium. After databases, I hit up a range of other data sources such as web scraping (rvest, 2014), Excel (readxl, 2015), rectangular text files (readr, 2015), SPSS/SAS/Stata (haven, 2015), and XML (xml2, 2015). None of these packages would have been possible without my new found C++ skills, as they all relied on tight integration with existing C libraries.</p>
<p>Around this time I started to become particularly well known in the R community. This lead to a couple of popular virtual Q&amp;A sessions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/">Reddit</a> (2015) and <a href="https://quorasessionwithhadleywickham.quora.com">Quora</a> (2016); these are good places to look if you’re interested in getting a snapshot of my thinking at the time.</p>

<p>As the collection of packages I had developed grew, the community needed some name to refer to them collectively, and many people started calling them the “Hadleyverse” (e.g.&nbsp;https://github.com/imanuelcostigan/hadleyverse). I found this name unappealing because the packages weren’t just my work and I felt uncomfortable tying the work so closely to my name. So I started brainstorming an “official” name that I could live with. Unfortunately I can no longer find the discussion, but possibl names included the sleekverse, the dapperverse, and the deftverse. It seems inevitable now that it should be called the tidyverse, given the success of tidy data, and announced this name to the world at my keynote at useR on June 29, 2016.</p>
<p>A few months later in September, I released the <a href="https://posit.co/blog/tidyverse-1-0-0/">tidyverse package</a>. This package had two main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To make it easy to install all packages in the tidyverse with a single line of code, <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code> so that folks could easily get a “batteries included” data science environment.</p></li>
<li><p>To make it easy to load the most common packages, so that you could type <code>library(tidyverse)</code> instead of having to load packages one by one. We called these packages the <strong>core</strong> packgaes and in the first release these were ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble. tidyerse 1.2.0 (September 2017) added forcats and stringr to the core packages, and tidyverse 2.0.0 (March 2023) added lubridate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Naming tidyverse created a bigger question. What exactly is the tidyverse? What are the unifying principles the underlie all packages in the tidyverse? In my useR talk I cited three unifying principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform data structures</li>
<li>Uniform APIs</li>
<li>Support referential transparency</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the first two are straightforward to understand: it’s easy to learn new tools if they share data structure and interface design with existing tools. That way you can learn a few big new ideas and then apply in as many places. But what does referential transparency refer to? That’s a call to the principles of tidy evaluation, which we’ll come back to shortly.</p>
<p>I think the first two are straightforward to understand. The goal of the tidyverse is to make it easy to learn by sharing data structures and interface design across as many functions as possible. You learn a few big new ideas and then apply them in as many places as possible. But what does referential transparency refer to? That’s a call to the principles of tidy evaluation, which we’ll come back to shortly.</p>
<p>I repeated this talk a few times and by December the principles had been refined to these four:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share data structures (i.e.&nbsp;tidy tibbles).</li>
<li>Compose simple pieces (i.e.&nbsp;use the pipe).</li>
<li>Embrace functional programming (instead of for loops).</li>
<li>Write for humans.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. –— Hal Abelson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since that time I’ve continued to refine my description of what it means to be part of the tidyverse. You can see my latest iteration at <a href="https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying.html" class="uri">https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying.html</a>. At the time of writing this paper, the four principles were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is <strong>human centered</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;the tidyverse is designed specifically to support the activities of a human data analyst.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>consistent</strong>, so that what you learn about one function or package can be applied to another, and the number of special cases that you need to remember is as small as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>composable</strong>, allowing you to solve complex problems by breaking them down into small pieces, supporting a rapid cycle of exploratory iteration to find the best solution.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong>inclusive</strong>, because the tidyverse is not just the collection of packages, but it is also the community of people who use them.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="key-innovations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-innovations">Key innovations</h2>
<p>In this section, I’ll discuss five specific innovations strongly associated with the tidyverse: tidy data, tibbles, the pipe, tidy evaluation, and hex stickers.</p>
<section id="tidy-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidy-data">Tidy data</h3>
<p>I’ve always had a very strong sense that there’s a “right” way to organise your data, a way that would make the rest of your analysis much easier. When looking at a dataset I could usually identify what form would be most productive, but I had a time explaining what I was doing to others, and experience numerous failures when trying to teach my approach. But eventually I stumbled on what now seems obvious, the principles of tidy data<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> explained in <span class="citation" data-cites="tidy-data">Wickham (<a href="#ref-tidy-data" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable goes in a column.</li>
<li>Each observation goes in a row.</li>
<li>Each value goes in a cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition seems to mostly work for people, even without a precise definition of variable and observation, and make it much easier for folks to identify the structure of a data set and how it needed be transformed.</p>
<p>TODO: When I learned visualisation with base R, I struggled with the variety of data structures that different plotting functions could use. For example, <code>plot()</code> can either take vectors of data (e.g.&nbsp;<code>plot(x, y)</code>) or a formula and a data frame (e.g.&nbsp;<code>plot(y ~ x, data = df)</code>). But if you want to plot multiple series at once you need to use <code>matplot()</code>, <code>matpoints()</code>, or <code>matlines()</code>, all of which take a matrix.</p>
<p>The tools needs to effect that transformation quite some iteration and evolution before I was happy with them. The tidy data paper was paired with the tidyr package, which initially provided the <code>gather()</code> and <code>spread()</code> functions. Unfortunately many people (including me!) had a hard time remembering which was which and what their arguments did. Additionally, their design wasn’t quite flexible enough to handle all the problems which we later discovered in practice. In <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/">tidyr 1.0.0</a> (2019) resolved many of these problems by introducing the new<code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> functions<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>tidyr 1.0.0 also expanded the scope of the package to encompass “rectangling”, what we called turning hierarchical data into tidy rectangles. This was becoming increasingly important as more data was coming from JSON web API, which tended to produce highly nested data structures. You can learn more about the problem and the solutions that tidyr provides in the tidyr <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html">rectangling vignette</a>.</p>
<!--
This work also stimulated my thinking around the more complex data structures that nested data frames inside of other data frames. \@fig-nest-pack-chop illustrates my thinking at the time, connecting three different ways of representing the same data. My enthusiasm for these data structures has waxed and waned over the years, but they're certainly theoretical structures and I really appreciate the beauty of an approach that unifies the ways of working with them.

::: {#fig-nest-pack-chop}
![](nest-pack-chop.png)

Three ways of representing the same data. On the right, we have a flat data frame. On the right, a nested data frame, where the data column is a list of data frames. On the bottom, we have a packed data frame, where the data column is itself a data frame.

<section id="tibbles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tibbles">tibbles</h3>
<p>Tidy data provides the big picture theoretical framework to help you understand productive ways of organising your data. But you also need convenient data structures to work with your tidy data and I created the tibble (an extension of the base R data.frame class) to solve a few problems that I found annoying. The problems are individually rather small, but I believed that they added needless friction and I had the confidence to believe I could do better.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data frames often flood your console with output when working with datasets containing many rows or many columns. In older versions of R, you couldn’t even abort this printing, so you could easily lock yourself out of the console for quite a long time if you printed a big data frame. tibbles only print a small number of rows and only the columns that fit on one screen.</p></li>
<li><p>When teaching, I found that students didn’t have a good sense of the type of each column, and even I sometimes found myself confused about whether a column was a date, a string, or factor. To avoid this problem, tibbles show (abbreviated) variable types underneath the column names.</p></li>
<li><p>In the unfortunate case you have <code>data.frame(x = c(NA, "&lt;NA&gt;"))</code>, there’s no way to figure to distinguish the two values from the printed output. Tibbles use a side-channel, colour, to ensure that there’s no way to confuse a missing value with a string that has the same printed representation.</p></li>
<li><p>My experiments with nested and packed columns required better printing tools. While they are technically supported by base data frames their printing is sufficiently confusing that their utility is much hampered. Tibbles strive to represent these more complex data types in an readable way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a few gotchas with subsetting data frames that make it easy to make silent errors in package code. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>df[, cols]</code> will return a vector if <code>cols</code> selects one column and a data frame if it selects more than one column.</p></li>
<li><p><code>df$x</code> does partial matching, so that if column <code>x</code>doesn’t exist but column <code>xyz</code> does, it will silently return <code>df$xyz</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, subsetting a tibble with <code>[</code> always returns another tibble and <code>$</code> never does partial matching. It will also complain if <code>x</code> does not exist. This why I jokingly say that tibbles are a lazier and surlier version of data frames.</p>
<p>tibbles started life in dplyr, originally just called <code>tbl_df</code> with no suggestion as how to pronounce this pure consonant class name. <a href="https://x.com/kevin_ushey/status/514659005621219329">Kevin Ushey</a> proposed pronouncing them as tibble-diff in 2014, and the tibble bit stuck. As the utility and complexity of tibbles expanded, they need more space to grow and were <a href="https://posit.co/blog/tibble-1-0-0/">extracted into their own package</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>tibbles were a much more contentious data structure than I had anticipated. They broke code in older packages, and my strong opinions about the formatting of significant digits also caused some consternation. That seems to have mostly died down now. Today I am much more cautious about introducing new data strucutres: they are fundamentally much more costly that introduction new functiosn and packages, and even programming paradigms.</p>

<section id="the-pipe" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-pipe">The pipe</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>No matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines the power of the system.</p>
<p>— Hal Abelson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pipe has grown to be one of the defining features of the tidyverse. It allows you to rewrite function composition (e.g.&nbsp;<code>f(g(x)))</code> as a linear sequence of transformations (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x |&gt; f() |&gt; g()</code>). This makes certain programming patterns that are common in data science much easier to read, and has gained rapid community adoption.</p>
<p>My first attempt at the pipe was implemented in dplyr in Oct 2013 and called <code>%.%</code>. When I announced dplyr in Jan 2014, I learned that Stefan Milton Bache had been thinking along similar lines and had created the magrittr package. It used <code>%&gt;%</code> instead of <code>%.%</code>, which was easier to type since you can hold down the shift button the whole time<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, and had more comprehensive features. So I quickly switched to magrittr and deprecated <code>%.%</code>. If you’d like to learn more about the history, I’d highly recommend “<a href="http://adolfoalvarez.cl/blog/2021-09-16-plumbers-chains-and-famous-painters-the-history-of-the-pipe-operator-in-r/">Plumbers, chains, and famous painters: The (updated) history of the pipe operator in R</a>” by Adolfo Álvarez.</p>
<p>Today the pipe is available in base R thanks to much collaborative effort. Lionel Henry <a href="https://lionelhenry.github.io/2016/02/15/ideas-for-an-updated-r-syntax/index.html">proposed new syntax</a> and wrote a patch to R in 2016 and Jim Hester presented it at the DSC in 2017. This had a positive impact but it took some time for the R Core Team to fully align on its benefits. But thanks to the work of Luke Tierney it was added to R in 4.1 (2020) along with lambda syntax and raw strings. Because R could modify the parser, the base pipe was written <code>|&gt;</code>. Took a few iterations to get a placeholder syntax (<code>_</code> in 4.2) and the ability to pipe into functions like <code>$</code> (in 4.3). Today, we are gradually moving all tidyverse packages to use base pipe.</p>
<p>As an interesting historial anecdote, there would have been no need for ggplot2 had I discovered the pipe earlier, as ggplot was based on function composition. I correctly identified that function composition was an unappealing user interface, but if I had discovered the pipe at that time, ggplot could have used it, rather than requiring the switch to <code>+</code> in ggplot2. You can <a href="https://github.com/hadley/ggplot1">try out ggplot</a> if you want, or <a href="https://forum.posit.co/t/why-cant-ggplot2-use/4372/7%3E">learn why ggplot2 can’t switch to the pipe</a>.</p>

<section id="tidy-evaluation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidy-evaluation">Tidy evaluation</h3>
<p>One of the most contentious features of the tidyverse has been the idea of tidy evaluation. The goal of tidy evaluation is to solve a problem introduced by ggplot2 and dplyr’s syntax that allows you to mix variables defined in the current environment with variables defined in some data frame. This makes interactive data analysis much more fluent at the cost of making programming much harder.</p>
<p>https://posit.co/blog/dplyr-0-3-2/ — <code>_</code> sufffixes</p>
<p>The need for tidy evaluation is fairly simple to explain. If you have repeated code, you typically want to extract out a function:</p>

<p>But the naive approach doesn’t work:</p>

</div></div>
<p>It took multiple years of struggle to get to a place that we are happy with. Started with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lazyeval">lazyeval</a> [2014-2017]. While this approach worked initially, it abused R internals in a way that eventually stopped working.</p>
<p>This lead to the development of the tidy evaluation framework which had five big ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code is a tree</li>
<li>You can capture the tree by “quoting”</li>
<li>You can use unquoting to build new trees</li>
<li>quoting + unquoting …</li>
<li>Quosures capture the tree + the evaluation environment</li>
</ul>
<p>I still believe that these big ideas are correct and useful. But they’re primary useful for creating a strong underlying theory. During 2017 and 2018 I gave 12 talks on tidyeval to audiences around the world, trying to convince others that they could use tidyeval for their own code. But this was much less effective than I had hoped and there were general rumblings in the community that tidyeval was too hard. (e.g.&nbsp;commuity posts titled “Should tidyeval be abandoned?” and “Will tidyeval kill the tidyverse?”)</p>
<div class="cell-container"><div class="cell-decorator"><pre>In [8]:</pre></div><div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>grouped_mean <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(df, group_var, summary_var) {</span>

</div></div>
<p>This sent us back to the drawing board and eventually we came up with a new approach called embracing. This style introduced just one new operator <code>{ }</code>, which you use whenever you have an data-variable referenced by an environment-variable:</p>
<div class="cell-container"><div class="cell-decorator"><pre>In [9]:</pre></div><div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>grouped_mean <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf">function</span>(df, group_var, summary_var) {</span>

</div></div>
<p>We <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/06/rlang-0-4-0">launched this in 2019</a> and it seems to be have successful, as the number of complaints about tidy evaluation has greatly dropped. It’s still a hard technique to learn, but that challenge is now directly related to the growth of abstraction needs to</p>
<p>Because we didn’t pay enough attention to exactly what people were struggling with, we also missed a couple of common use cases that were surprisingly hard to solve. Now we have a <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html">cookbook</a> of tidy eval recipes that cover the most common situations that you’re likely to encounter, so that there’s usually one example you can modify.</p>
<p>Tidy evaluation is still one of the hardest parts to grasp, but I think that’s unavoidable. At least it’s now no longer harder than it needs to be. I think one of the reasons it’s hard is because understanding it requires distentangling two concepts that the tidyverse intentionally blurs: df-variables and env-variables. We use the same word for both, and one of the big features of the tidyverse is that it blurs their use. But to use tidyeval effectively you have to grasp the difference because you’ll end up with a reference to a df-var stored in an env-var. On top of the additional complexities of writing a funtion and losing access to some of your usual debugging tools, this makes tidyeval necesasarily complex.</p>

<section id="hex-logos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hex-logos">Hex logos</h3>
<p>You can’t talk about the history of the tidyverse without also talking about hex logos. While the early history of hex logos is now murky, from what I can tell, it appears that Stefan and I co-discovered hex stickers around the same time through <a href="https://hexb.in" class="uri">https://hexb.in</a>. I personally found the it super appealing to have a shape that can tile the back of a laptop, along with a spec that ensures everyone’s stickers are the same size and the same orientation (point down!).</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the first hex logo was magrittr’s<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>, designed in December 2014. Soon afterwards, in early 2015, I fully I embraced the idea of hex stickers and started creating them for key packages with the help of designer Greg Swinhart; you can see two early versions of the ggplot2 logo in <a href="#fig-early-logos" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>. By mid-2016 we were ordering them en masse for RStudio events, and we were beginning to see logos for other packages in the community. Today, a huge number of packages have a logo, and I love seeing the creativity and diversity package authors bring to their design.</p>

<p>The naming of the tidyverse coincided with the start of my team at RStudio, and the overarching journey from a project that was primarily developed by me to a project collaboratively owned by many people.</p>
<section id="the-people" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-people">The people</h3>
<p>Current members of the tidyverse team are Lionel Henry, Jenny Bryan, Gábor Csárdi, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Thomas Lin Pedersen, Davis Vaughan, George Stagg, and Teun Van den Brand. The tidymodels subteam (more on that below) is led by Max Kuhn and includes Hannah Frick, Simon Couch, and Emil Hvitfeldt.</p>
<p>Tidyverse team alumni are Jim Hester, Mara Averick, Romain Francois, Tracy Teal and Andy Teucher. Even these folks are no longer paid to work on the tidyverse, many of them still active community contributors and I consider all of them members of “team tidyverse”.</p>
<p>Posit also funded four ggplot2 summer interns: <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/posts/2016-10-31-becoming-the-intern/">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> (2016), <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/09/ggplot2-internship/">Kara Woo</a> (2017), <a href="https://www.danaseidel.com/MeetUpSlides">Dana Paige Seidel</a> (2018), and <a href="https://dewey.dunnington.ca/post/2019/a-summer-of-rstudio-and-ggplot2/">Dewey Dunnington</a> (2019). And there have been other paid contributors such as Kirill Muller, Oliver Gjoneski, Jeroen Ooms, and Charlie Gao.</p>

<section id="the-mission" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mission">The mission</h3>
<p>The mission of the tidyverse team is broad: we want to make R the best environment for doing data science. We have nothing against other programming languages (and certainly use others where appropriate), but we love R, believe in it, and want to keep our efforts focused.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to just to write code, but to help people find out. This means that members of the tidyverse team are expected to contribute in many different ways including <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog">writing blog posts</a>, writing books, speaking, teaching, and community building.</p>
<p>While tidyverse packages strive to provide a common core of tools that really help the most common 80% of problems encountered when analysing data. The remaining 20% of problems tend to be highly varied and we expect every analysis to use many other package. For this reason, we also strive to help every developer make their own high quality packages. You see this in books like <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz">Advanced R</a> and <a href="https://r-pkgs.org">R packages</a>, but also the development of the devtools family of packages which aim to make it easier to build R packages. This suite of package has been very impactful on the practice of package development with ~9,000 packages using testthat for unit testing, ~16,000 using roxygen2 for documentation, and ~12,000 using pkgdown to make package websites.</p>
<p>Generally, we are a process oriented team, and because we strive to work as much in the open as possible, we do our best to write up our processes so that others can benefit from them. This work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our package release checklist (as implemented in <code>usethis::use_release_isse()</code>) ensures that we maximise the chances of successful CRAN submission by following a standard process. Our process grows as we discover new problems, and shrinks as we figure out how to automate manual steps away.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org">tidyverse style guide</a>, probably the most commonly reference style guide in the R community, and used by organisations like Google.</p></li>
<li><p>We spend a lot of time reviewing code (both internally and externally) so we wrote up <a href="https://code-review.tidyverse.org">code review guidelines</a> to keep our own work consistent, and to help new contributors know what to expect.</p></li>
<li><p>We are slowly working on an exposition of the <a href="https://design.tidyverse.org">design principles</a> that guide the design of tidyverse APIs. This is helpful for us, because it makes it easier to remember design decisions and re-apply them the same way in multiple places, and also helps the community see reusable patterns that they can apply to their own code.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our broad mission means that recently we have been spending less time on tidyverse packages and more time on broader data science efforts; I’ll come back to these at the end of this paper.</p>
</section>
<section id="tidymodels" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidymodels">tidymodels</h3>
<p>Within the tidyverse team, the tidymodels team has a narrower mission: improving the tools data scientists need to fit (and trust) models in R. The tidymodels team started in late 2016 when Max Kuhn joined RStudio, after initial talks about how we could support statistical and ML modeling, talks which lead to the creation of the <a href="https://recipes.tidymodels.org">recipes</a> package.</p>
<p>Max was the obvious choice to found this team because of his work on the caret package. caret provided functionality for basic predictive modeling tasks such as performance measures and resampling as well as a consistent user interface. Max’s idea was to create a more extensible framework that would integrate more advanced tools, such as more complex pre- and post-processing, censored regression models, and others. The resulting collection of packages was called tidymodels and heavily relied on the tidyverse syntax and the underlying tools being developed (e.g., non-standard evaluation, etc.).</p>
<p>tidymodels took a somewhat cheeky approach to naming. For one package that was close in spirit to caret, Max’s initial idea was to give it the code name “carrot” to confuse outside users. Hadley proposed “parsnip,” and this became the working name. However, eventually this name was codified by the community and was retained. The tidymodels team has been composed of between two and six people over the years, and its <a href="https://github.com/tidymodels">GitHub repository</a> currently contains over 40 packages for modeling and predicting data.</p>

<section id="tidyverse-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidyverse-community">Tidyverse community</h2>
<p>The tidyverse is certainly not just me, and isn’t even just the team of people paid to work on it full time. It’s primarily the community of people outside of Posit who use it and contribute to its development in many ways, big and small. The community is the reason we work so hard. Tremendously rewarding to see people using the tidyverse to analyse data in so many different domains.</p>
<p>I also enjoy watching people grow as contributors, possibly starting off filing issues, learning how to create good reprexes, contributing documentation improvements and bug fixes, answer other people’s questions, propopsing new designs and thoughtfully critiquing existing designs, brainstorming better names. The tidyverse wouldn’t be a fraction as good as it is today without the many ways that the community has helped make it better.</p>
<p>We make a yearly in-person attempt to support contributors through the tidyverse developer days in <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/04/tdd-2024/">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/02/tidy-dev-days-2020/">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/tidyverse-dev-day-at-user-2019/">2019</a>. These were disrupted by Covid, but we hope to run annually. They are a really fun time for the tidyverse team, and designed to get as many community members as possible to contribute.</p>
<section id="social-media" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-media">Social media</h3>
<p>The precursors to the tidyverse were greatly aided by discussions on mailing lists, like r-help. But these mailing lists were of the era where the majority of R user had PhD’s in statistics and they were infamous for rude responses and general unkindness to new learners. I started a ggplot2 mailing list in 2008, explicitly to provide a more friendly place to ask questions.</p>

<section id="r-for-data-science" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-for-data-science">R for Data Science</h3>
<p>I’m a big believer in the power of books to get big ideas into the hands of the community. Equally important to me that the books be available to all, regardless of their ability to pay. That’s why all the books I work on have a dual production model: a free online version that I 100% produce and a paid print version made in conjunction with a book publisher.</p>
<p>The book most closely associated with the tidyverse is R for data science (2017, 2023). The first edition was written in collaboration with Garrett Grolemund, and the second with Mine Çentinkaya Rundel. Very impactful work.</p>
<p>Many translations. I’m particularly enamored of the community translations which now include Spanish, Portugese, Turkish, and Italian. But commercial translations also included Russian, Polish, Japanese, Chinese (traditional) and Chinese (simplified).</p>
</section>
<section id="package-authors" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="package-authors">Package authors</h3>
<p>Most external contributors tend to provide a few small (but meaningful!) contributions. A select few external contributors end up contributing much time and effort over the course of many years. We recognise these contributors by officially making them package authors. This formally includes them in package metadata (so they are explicitly acknowledged on CRAN, on the package website, and in the pacakge citation) and gives them write access to the GitHub repository. You can learn more about the rights and responsibilities of authors (and other roles) in our <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyups/blob/main/004-governance.md">tidyverse governance model</a>.</p>
<p>Many package authors are academics, and since the currency of academics is citation, in 2019 we made the effort to write <span class="citation" data-cites="tidyverse-welcome">Wickham et al. (<a href="#ref-tidyverse-welcome" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>. This makes it easy to cite the tidyverse as a whole<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> (instead of having to cite individual packages) and also gives academic credit to tidyverse maintainers who might benefit from it: Mara Averick, Jennifer Bryan, Winston Chang, Lucy McGowan, Romain François, Garrett Grolemund, Alex Hayes, Lionel Henry, Jim Hester, Max Kuhn, Thomas Pedersen, Evan Miller, Stephan Bache, Kirill Müller, Jeroen Ooms, David Robinson, Dana Seidel, Vitalie Spinu, Kohske Takahashi, Davis Vaughan, Claus Wilke, Kara Woo, and Hiroaki Yutani. This paper has been cited ~16,000 times as of January 2025.</p>
<p>Since we’ve published that paper we’ve gained a few new maintainers including Maximilian Girlich (tidyr, dbplyr), Mark Fairbanks (dtplyr), Ryan Dickerson (dtplyr), Olivier Roy (pkgdown), Danny Smith (haven), Maxim Shemanarev (ragg), and Teun van den Brand (ggplot2).</p>

<section id="maintaining-the-tidyverse" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maintaining-the-tidyverse">Maintaining the tidyverse</h2>
<p>For the last few years, the tidyverse has felt pretty mature to me. It’s certainly not perfect, but it feels like we have all of the main pieces in place, and much of the remaining work is grinding down the minor inconsistencies between them. Overall, the goal of the tidyverse is now consoliation and maintainence, not growth. There have been three major initiatives that have helped us create a more cohesive and streamlined experience for everyone using it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In 2019, we created a formal policy as to <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/">which versions of R we support</a>: the current version, the devel version, and the previous four versions. Coupled with R’s yearly release cycle, this means we support 5 years worth of R versions. This policy is important because many large enterprises use older versions of R, but still want to be able to use the latest and greatest package versions. Supporting 5 years worth of R versions only increases our maintenance burden slightly. The major downside is that we can rely on new R features only five years after they’re implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2020 and early 2021, <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/02/lifecycle-1-0-0/" class="uri">https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/02/lifecycle-1-0-0/</a>. 20-maintenace rstudio::global(2020). During the tidyverse’s early life, there were a lot of changes as we iterated towards the right solutions in many different domains. We got the message from the community that the pace of change was too high, and so we we firmed up our policies around deprecating and removing tidyverse functions. We also introduced a new lifecycle phase called “superseded”; these are functions that we no longer recommend for new code but because of their widespread usage we have no plans to remove (but they will no longer be actively developed).</p></li>
<li><p>In late 2021, thanks to the hard work on Mara Averick, we <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/relicensing-packages/">relicensed most tidyverse packages to MIT</a>. This increased consistency across tidyverse packages, making it easier for legally conservative organisations to convince themselves their was little risk to using the tidyvrse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What does the future hold? When I think about the tidyverse today, there’s only one sweeping change that I’d like to make, and that’s introducing <em>editions</em>. You would deliberately opt-in to an edition by running code like <code>tidyverse::edition(2025)</code>, stating that you want to adopt our recommended practices as of 2025. Editions would generally change defaults and disable superseded functions and arguments, ensuring that you’re using our latest API recommendations. Editions makes it possible for us to change behaviour that we now believe is suboptimal without breaking existing code. You can continue to use the latest package versions (ensuring that you get new features and bug fixes) but you can increase the edition when its convenient for you to spend some time refactoring your code. For example, we could use editions to change the default colour schemes in ggplot2, which we now know could be improved.</p>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>As the tidyverse becomes more mature, the places where the tidyverse team spends our innovation energy have started to change. Broadly, the mission of the team is to make R more awesome for doing data science, and we’re willing to go whereever this takes us. Currently there are three new areas that we are exploring as a team:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Positron</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/positron">Positron</a> is a new IDE for data science, produced by the same team that created RStudio. The tidyverse team has been deeply involved in the R tooling. This is exciting because it gives us the skills for tighter integrations in the future. Code where coding makes sense, and use an graphical user interface where that is a better fit for the task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R in production</strong>. If you’re working in industry, most tasks aren’t completed by writing a one-off report. Instead you will typically produce an artifact that’s run repeatedly on another machine. This is the challenge of putting your code in production, which in my opinion at least currently suffers from a thousand paper cuts. From getting your database authentication to work to ensuring that you’re using exactly the same dependencies both in development and deployment, and over time, there are a lot of rough edges that you have to overcome that are not directly related to doing data science. I’m convinced that we can make this better.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LLMs for data science</strong>. Pretty clear now that LLMs are going to have a transformative impact on how we do data science. We see them as invaluable assistants for the data scientist, not replacements. Allow you to get help where you need it and automate fiddly annoying tasks. Also provides a new tool kit creating tidy data frames from unstructured data, which seems likely to considerably expand the reach of the tidyverse to new types of data. Still very early days, but one initiative is the <a href="https://ellmer.tidyverse.org">ellmer package</a> which lets you call LLMs from R.</p></li>
